model was run 100 epochs at a time, output model was fed in as input model for next 100 epochs

runs stopped at 550 due to:
"Stopping training early as no improvement observed in last 50 epochs. Best results observed at epoch 511, best model saved as best.pt.
To update EarlyStopping(patience=50) pass a new patience value, i.e. `patience=300` or use `patience=0` to disable EarlyStopping."
